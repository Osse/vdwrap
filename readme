vdwrap
======

A simple wrapper around vimdiff for diffing directory hierarchies with git
difftool --dir-diff. It is a zsh script, so you need zsh installed.

With vdwrap instead of launching vimdiff once per file pair it will launch
vimdiff only once and you will see each file pair in its own tab.

Configuration:
--------------

Either you can configure this as your git difftool staright up, or you can use
it only when using --dir-diff. When used not with --dir-diff it tries its best
to invoke vimdiff the same way git difftool would have done anyway. I haven't
noticed any problems but it is a bit hacky.

In any case, put vdwrap somewhere in your $PATH and run

$ git config --global difftool.vdwrap.cmd 'vdwrap $LOCAL $REMOTE'

If you don't want to put it in your path you can either also run

$ git config --global difftool.vdwrap.path '/full/path'

or define the difftool using the full path:

$ git config --global difftool.vdwrap.cmd '/full/path/vdwrap $LOCAL $REMOTE'

$ git config --global diff.tool vdwrap

If you want to keep vimdiff as the standard difftool and use the wrapper with
--dir-diff you can define an alias, e.g.:

$ git config --global alias.dirdiff 'difftool --tool vdwrap --dir-diff'

Usage:
------

If you configure vdwrap as your difftool you do:

$ git difftool --dir-diff foo bar
$ git difftool foo bar

The latter should work just like normal.

Alternatively, using the alias:

$ git dirdiff foo bar
$ git difftool foo bar

Since difftool --dir-diff is longwinded you may want to define an alias anyway,
so it makes sense to not use vdwrap as your standard difftool.
